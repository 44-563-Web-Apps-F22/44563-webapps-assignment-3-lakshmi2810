    <h3> Seetha Ramam </h3>
    <p> Sita Ramam is a visually beautiful tale of love and loss. It has all the makings of being labelled a classic love story, but falls short in certain aspects. The film flits between two time period â€” the 1960s and the 1980s. It starts with a patriotic young Pakistani woman, Afreen, burning a car of a respected Indian figure in London in 1980s. She has a massive hatred for anything or anyone Indian. She is symbolises the animosity and hatred that brewed between India and Pakistan after the partition. Her hatred of Indians does not stem from personal experience though. She is the granddaughter of Brigadier Taariq, who is clearly against her blind hatred of the neighbouring country.</p>
